# Fiori Tracker Suite

Fiori Tracker is a suite of SAP Fiori-native apps for keeping a record of your SAP Fiori launchpad's implementation or maintenance scope. The scope is the list of the applications and catalogs you plan to implement or support (referred to as "To-be" records). Application's and catalog's "To-be" records serve as a reference for comparison with actual system configuration (called "As-is"). "As-is" relations enable the project team to control setting up the SAP Fiori launchpad, crucial in projects with many applications deployed across multiple systems.
