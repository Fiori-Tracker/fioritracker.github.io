# Clarity of responsibility 

Diffused responsibility on the content that is shared.

One of the goals of project management is clarity of responsibility.

Fiori Tracker shows who is responsible for each SAP Fiori application. The information is available directly from the application (using the Fiori Launchpad plugin) or through the application details view.

Fiori Tracker determines the name of the responsible consultant based on the functional stream name (business area). Each app is tied to stream, and stream has the name of the consultant assigned. Using stream assignment enables the change of the name of the consultant without updating all apps attributes. Allocation by area helps you deal with team turnovers.

Responsible consultant determination is available for all Fiori Launchpad content, including business catalogs, groups, and roles. Fiori Tracker also uses area-consultant assignment to populate the default assignee in the [sign-off function](../../so/FPS01/main.md).
