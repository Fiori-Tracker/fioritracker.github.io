Shape user roles to fit actual needs

<!-- more -->

One of the approaches to building the user's roles is to enable all or a wide range of applications and, over time, collect usage information. With a usage report, the project can learn what users need, and based on the actual usage of the apps, the project can set up final, limited roles.
