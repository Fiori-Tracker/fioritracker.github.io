# Enforcing naming conventions

Consistent naming when different team members create and change content identifiers.

<!-- more -->

Each set of the implemented SAP Fiori apps will require grouping them into the Fiori launchpad catalogs and groups. In projects with functional streams, a number of functional leads (3-7) come up with their set of groups depending on their stream user needs.

The consistent naming convention shared by the streams will make handling the catalogs and groups easier. Working with consistently named content will be important later when other team members, like the SAP Fiori developers or Basis specialists, start handling configuration during support and maintenance.
