    === "Details"

        See the [use cases we have identified](usecases/index.md).

    === "Example"

        - Support of SAP Gateway migration
        - App Optimization: Identify key apps, deprecate others
        - Focus on performance improvements post-migration
        - Streamlining apps for faster deployment

??? "4. A project member who can provide a testimonial on planned use cases."

    === "Details"

        We need first, last name and role in the SAP S/4HANA project and the contents of the testimonial. We can provide a prompt to make it super easy.

    === "Example"

        We plan to use Fiori Tracker Suite, for our migration from Standalone Gateway to Embedded Gateway. With Fiori Tracker, we aim to identify the most important apps and those that can be deprecated, simplifying the upgrade team's workload.

        Post-migration, we will also focus on improving performance. Fiori Tracker will help us streamline our app portfolio, ensuring the embedded deployment runs faster and more efficiently.

## Process steps

1. Once we have the above, we prepare a draft of the article (called "Customer Reference") 
2. We send it to you for approval
3. We publish this customer reference article on the Fiori Tracker page, LinkedIn, and SAP Community.
4. We are sending you the transport files and instructions on installing the product
5. If needed, we support you with installation 
- Call with screen sharing
- Discord
- If we get access to your system, we can install it for you
6. You start using Fiori Tracker
7. After one moth of use we would adopt the testimonial describing the feedback regarding actual experience with the tool
