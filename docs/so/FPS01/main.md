# Sign-offs

The Sign-offs app lets you create, change and list sign-off records linked to all SAP Fiori launchpad key deliverables: apps, catalogs, and roles. The sign-off records are team members' formal acknowledgments of delivery. Feature configuration lets you define your project-specific sign-off types and default sign-off assignees. Assignees are determined based on the deliverable's leading area.
