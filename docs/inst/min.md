# Minimal installation requirements for all Fiori Tracker Suite apps

!!! Note
    The minimal requirement for Fiori Tracker is any SAP system with GAP Gateway (software component SAP_GWFND).

Fiori Tracker frontend part requires SAP NetWeaver version at least 7.52 with SAP Gateway with SAP UI5 library at least version: 1.48.9 (UI software component in version: SAP_UI 752 SP00 or above Support Package). 

On systems that do not offer UI5 1.48.9 or higher, you can run Fiori Tracker run from [Technical launchpad](../ui5lib-options.md).

Fiori Tracker Suite will work in both HUB and Embedded deployment.
